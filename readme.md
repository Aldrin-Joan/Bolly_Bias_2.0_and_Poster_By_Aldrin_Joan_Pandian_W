# 🎬 Bollywood Bias Buster 2.0  
**AI Project | Internship at docu3C Technologies**

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

**BollyAI 2.0** is a multimodal AI system that detects, quantifies, and mitigates gender bias in Bollywood films using LLMs and traditional NLP techniques. This second version expands analysis across **scripts**, **wikipedia data**, **posters**, **trailers**, and **songs**, creating a comprehensive gender bias dashboard that blends data science with prompt engineering.
