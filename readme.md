# 🎬 Bollywood Bias Buster 2.0  
**AI Project | Internship at docu3C Technologies**

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

**BollyAI 2.0** is a multimodal AI system that detects, quantifies, and mitigates gender bias in Bollywood films using LLMs and traditional NLP techniques. This second version expands analysis across **scripts**, **wikipedia data**, **posters**, **trailers**, and **songs**, creating a comprehensive gender bias dashboard that blends data science with prompt engineering.

## 🧠 Bias Taxonomy (Script Module)

The system identifies the following 14 gender stereotypes in movie dialogues:

| Stereotype Type          | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `occupation_gap`         | Character lacks a job, career, or professional identity.                    |
| `agency_gap`             | Character is passive, submissive, or lacks decision-making.                 |
| `appearance_focus`       | Emphasis on beauty, clothes, or body (non-sexual).                          |
| `relationship_only`      | Exists only as wife, daughter, sister, etc.                                 |
| `screen_time_disparity`  | Dialogue indicates minimal screen presence for women.                       |
| `dialogue_initiation_gap`| Character only responds, doesn't initiate conversations.                    |
| `emotional_typecast`     | Shown only as emotional, irrational, or tearful.                            |
| `domesticity_emphasis`   | Focus on homemaking roles like cooking or cleaning.                         |
| `objectification`        | Sexualized portrayal of body through camera or narrative.                   |
| `victim_only`            | Exists only to be harmed or rescued, lacking agency.                        |
| `intelligence_undermined`| Character is portrayed as dumb, ditzy, or confused.                         |
| `support_role_only`      | Exists only to support a male lead without her own arc.                     |
| `villainization`         | Character unfairly framed as evil or manipulative.                          |
| `none`                   | Empowering, neutral, or progressive portrayal.                              |
